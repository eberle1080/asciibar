This little library has one purpose: displaying progress on the
terminal. Yes, you can display any kind of progress you want.
Old folks, young folks, even your dog! If you need to display
progress, this will cure all of your woes. It even has an ETA
calculation built in.

Usage is loosely documented in example.c. This was developed for
Linux, but it may work on Windows (NOT tested). Ascii bar is
pretty stable, but if it suddely flips a random bit on your drive
(a la M-x butterfly) just remember that no software is perfect,
and that you were warned.

Here's a very simple example of how easy this is to use, assuming
you don't want any bells or whistles.

struct ascii_bar_params params;
init_ascii_bar(&params, $MIN, $MAX, $STEP);

while(do_work)
{
    ...
    set_ascii_bar(&params, $VALUE);
}

printf("\n");
